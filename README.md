# Chaos Engineering Simulations for Distributed Systems

This repository showcases my load testing and chaos engineering work, inspired by Netflix’s Chaos Monkey, as part of my senior comps (capstone) project at Carleton College.

While the full system code is protected under academic ownership, this repo includes **my individual contributions** — including testing scripts, simulation plans, and architectural insights — designed to test the resiliency and fault tolerance of a distributed chess platform hosted on Azure.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

- Designed to **simulate real-world failures** (e.g. service crashes, DB timeouts, delayed responses).
- Built to **test how distributed systems recover** from faults using custom load testing and fault injection tools.
- Inspired by [Chaos Monkey](https://netflix.github.io/chaosmonkey/) — an industry tool for resilience testing.

---

## 🔧 My Contributions

- Developed **Python and shell-based load testing tools** to stress APIs and services.
- Created **fault injection scenarios** for simulating latency, node failures, and database issues.
- Assisted in designing the **system’s monitoring and health recovery strategies**.
- Worked closely with Azure-hosted services and simulated failure points in deployment.

## ❓Can I Run This?

While the core platform code is not public, the **load testing scripts in this repo can be run independently** for learning/demo purposes.  
You can explore fault simulation logic and design your own test environments using these tools.
